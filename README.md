Gargoyle is a minimal CSS stylesheet intended to serve as a base template for any article-based website.

Features a centred single-column layout on an off-white background, set against an even baseline grid.
Flexibly adjusts for screens of various sizes and highly robust against non-standard browser behaviour.

Please note that for optimal results, vertical spacing and font settings should be adjusted to suit the specific fonts in use.
